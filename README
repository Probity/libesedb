# Building On Windows

From Powershell run the following scripts:

* synclibs.ps1
* autogen.ps1

This should pull down other libyal dependendencies and generate appropriate header files (common\Types.h, include\libpff.h, etc)

From cmd run the following commands:

* msbuild msvscpp\libesedb\libesedb.sln /p:Platform=x64;Configuration=Debug
* msbuild msvscpp\libesedb\libesedb.sln /p:Platform=x64;Configuration=Release

libesedb.lib & libesedb.dll is now available here

* \msvscpp\libesedb\x64\Debug
* \msvscpp\libesedb\x64\Release
